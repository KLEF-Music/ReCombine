## Documentation

See the full documentation on [ReCombine.io](https://recombine.io)

## Why ReCombine?

- **Simple**
   - 📈 [Combine reducers](./reducers.html) makes scaling easy.
   - 🤝 [Side Effects](./effects.html) allow abstraction of asynchronous calls. 
- **Performant** 
   - 💨 Uses Combine, boosting performance in comparison to Redux libraries that use RxSwift.
   - 🦁 Implements performance optimizations for you, including [memoized selectors](./selectors.html).
- **Native** 
   - 📲 Interacts seemlessly with SwiftUI.
   - 🛠 Only depends on Combine under the hood.

## Inspiration

The API is inspired by [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/), Angular's most popular Redux framework.
