/// Combines multiple reducer functions into a single reducer function.  Each reducer function must reduce the same type.
/// - Parameter reducers: reducers to be combined into a single reducer.
///
/// Usually, you will want to to convert multiple key-specific reducers into a single reducer to represent an entire type using `forKey(_:use:)`.
/// ```
/// struct Scoreboard {
///     var home = 0
///     var away = 0
/// }
///
/// let scoreboardReducer: ReducerFn<Scoreboard> = combineReducers(
///    forKey(\.home, use: homeScoreReducer),
///    forKey(\.away, use: awayScoreReducer)
/// )
/// ```

/// Convert a reducer function for a specific instance property into a reducer function for the entire instance.
/// - Parameter keyPath: The key of the instance property to be reduced.
/// - Parameter reducer: The reducer function for the given instance property.
///
/// Usually paired with `combineReducers(_:)`.
///
/// The following example converts a reducer that only reduces the home score into a reducer that reduces the entire Scoreboard:
/// ```
/// struct Scoreboard {
///     var home = 0
///     var away = 0
/// }
///
/// let homeScoreReducer: ReducerFn<Int> = { (state: Int, action) in
///     var state = state
///     switch action {
///         case let action as HomeScore:
///             state += 1
///             return state
///         default:
///             return state
///     }
/// }
///
/// let homeKeyReducer: ReducerFn<Scoreboard> = forKey(\.home, use: homeScoreReducer)
/// ```
